# General

Using the `Notable` app for managing these documents. Easy to read and to have a backup on github.

### _Notable_ functionalities

- `cmd + alt + s` 
switches back and forth between a split view of rendered markdown and the editor to just the render.
- **relative links**
[a relative link to Bash notes](Bash.md)
- **colour text** 
that gets included when exported to pdf: <span style="color:orange">Color HTML via **span**</span>
- **nested tags**
just use forward slash: `Notebooks/Skills/Tech/`, nesting is allowed
