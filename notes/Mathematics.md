# Mathematics

### Notation

Using KaTeX instead of LaTeX because that's what Notable supports.

- $\propto$
symbol for proportionality (it's not an alpha $\alpha$), alternatively ~ is used. It means that two values $x \propto y$ grow or decrease together by some ratio. For example the circumference of a circle is _directly_ proportional to its diameter, with constant proportionality $\pi$.

- $\triangleq$
Is a symbol for _defined as_. Or more precisely _equal by definition_. As opposed to $\coloneqq$ which is the main symbol for definition.

- $\coloneqq$
symbol of _defined as_.

- $\sim$
the long tilde is used to mean _equivalence_.

### Greek alphabet
- $\tau, \Tau$ - tau
- $\theta, \Theta$ - theta, often denotes learnable parameters
- $\mu, \Mu$ - pronounced _mju_, usually used to mean the mean (average)
- $\sigma, \Sigma$ - pronunciation _sigma_, lowercase is standard deviation, uppercase is sum.
