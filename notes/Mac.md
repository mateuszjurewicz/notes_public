# Mac

- `ctrl + cmd + q` - lock screen
- `cmd + m` - minimize the current active window (to dock)
- `cmd + tab + down_arrow + enter` - select minimized window and bring it back up (have to navigate to the app via `cmd + tab` and whilst holding it, use arrow keys to select and then press enter)
- `ctrl + cmd +f` or `f`
full screen of the currently active window, or for youtube opened in Chrome, just `f`, when active.

### Two displays & full-screen
- `ctrl + left/right arrow` 
when having chrome open on two display screens, and full-screen on screen B, if you `cmd + tab` to another app on the B screen, you can use the above command to switch between "windows" to get back to the full screen'ed chrome, **but you may have to click /become active in the app that's currently on screen B.
