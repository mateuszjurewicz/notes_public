# Mac

### Two displays & full-screen
- `ctrl + left/right arrow` 
when having chrome open on two display screens, and full-screen on screen B, if you `cmd + tab` to another app on the B screen, you can use the above command to switch between "windows" to get back to the full screen'ed chrome, **but you may have to click /become active in the app that's currently on screen B.
