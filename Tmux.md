# Tmux

### Move panes
- `ctrl + b + }` move the current pane right (or left with `{`). Effectively swaps the placement of panes.
- `ctrl + b + [` allows for scrolling in the window (no shift needed for `[`, as opposed to `{`), `ctrl + c` to exit scrolling mode.


### General
- `ctrl + b + n` - move to next window 
- `ctrl + b + p` - move to previous window
- `ctrl + b + %` - split window vertically
- `ctrl + b + "` - split window horizontally
